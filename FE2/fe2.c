PID - Process IDentifier
PPID - Parent Process IDentifier
real U/GID - User/Group IDentifier of who initiated the process
current dir - directory to where names of files are referenced by default

environment - initially inherited from parent process
text space - memory where program instructions lie; read only
stack space - memory automatically managed
heap space - memory managed by the user in runtime
priority - info for process scheduling
signal disposition - masks for delivery or blocking of signals
umask - mask that restrains files' permissions on creation

/*

In a named pipe, the program described could be executed between unrelated processes to verify its premiss. 
As such, two named pipes would be set up between both, one representing the color to send and to process by 
the reading process, and one for the answer. The program would be as follows: the first process would write 
to the first pipe the color, and the second process would read it, process it, and put its response on the 
second pipe, which would be later read by the first process.

Using normal pipes, this program could only be implemented between child and parent processes. As such, the 
process could only verify that it had the color on its private pallete, using the corresponding pipe through 
a child co-process. This could not be extended to other processes using normal pipes as they don't allow 
unrelated process comunication.

It is impossible to execute the program described using signals since they do not allow to send information. 
Since there is no way to inform the second process what color he wants to refer to, the second process cannot 
form a valid response and the premisse of the program fails.
