A call to open() creates a new open file description, an entry in
the system-wide table of open files.  The open file description
records the file offset and the file status flags (see below).  A
file descriptor is a reference to an open file description; this
reference is unaffected if pathname is subsequently removed or
modified to refer to a different file.  For further details on
open file descriptions, see NOTES.
