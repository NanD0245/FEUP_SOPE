A CALL TO OPEN() CREATES A NEW OPEN FILE DESCRIPTION, AN ENTRY IN
THE SYSTEM-WIDE TABLE OF OPEN FILES.  THE OPEN FILE DESCRIPTION
RECORDS THE FILE OFFSET AND THE FILE STATUS FLAGS (SEE BELOW).  A
FILE DESCRIPTOR IS A REFERENCE TO AN OPEN FILE DESCRIPTION; THIS
REFERENCE IS UNAFFECTED IF PATHNAME IS SUBSEQUENTLY REMOVED OR
MODIFIED TO REFER TO A DIFFERENT FILE.  FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON
OPEN FILE DESCRIPTIONS, SEE NOTES.
